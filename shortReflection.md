# Short Reflection Assignment

## Overview
The **Short Reflection** assignment is designed to encourage students to critically engage with the course material, reflect on key concepts, and connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications. These reflections provide an opportunity for students to consolidate their learning from lectures, labs, and readings in a structured yet concise manner.

Each reflection should be **500-700 words** and must be submitted as a **PDF document** via Canvas.

---

## Assignment Instructions
For each short reflection, students should address the following:

1. **Key Takeaways (2 points)**  
   - Summarize the most important insights from the **previous four lectures and two labs**.  
   - Explain how these concepts build on previous knowledge (including outside this course, within the program itself).  
   - If applicable, reference specific readings that helped clarify concepts.  

2. **Application & Examples (2 points)**  
   - Provide at least **one real-world example** where the concepts from class apply.  
   - This can be an industry application, a research case study, or an example from a dataset or paper.  
   - Include any relevant **code snippets, screenshots, or outputs** if applicable.  

3. **Personal Insights & Challenges (1 point)**  
   - Reflect on which concepts were **challenging or surprising** and why.  
   - Discuss how you overcame a difficulty (if any) or what you would need to fully understand the topic.  

4. **Question for Further Discussion (1 point)**  
   - End your reflection with **one thoughtful question** related to the material.  
   - This can be about an unclear concept, an ethical consideration, or a possible future research direction.
