# COLX 565: Sentiment Analysis

## Course Description

_Sentiment analysis_ in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL) involves identifying and analyzing polarity—positive, negative, neutral, or mixed—within text. This course provides a structured introduction to sentiment analysis methods, covering mostly modern deep learning techniques (with brief reference to classical methods). It combines lectures with hands-on lab sessions to ensure a balance between theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students are expected to:

1. Understand the Foundations of Sociopragmatic Meaning with a focus on Sentiment Analysis
2. Apply Classical Methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Sociopragmatics
3. Develop Real-World Sociopragmatics Systems Using LLMs and Agentic Workflows
4. Enhance Text Classification with Explaination and Retrieval-Augmented Models
5. Critically Evaluate Societal Considerations in Text Classification




## Meeting times / locations

This is a live presentation class.  Students are expected to attend lectures when possible.  Recordings will be available, but should be used as a study tool
instead of a primary method of learning the material.

Classes meet Tuesday and Thursday at 9:30 a.m. - 11:00 am, in MCLD 3018.
Labs are Tuesday from 2-6 p.m., in ORCH 4018.
 

## Attendance

The MDS-CL is an *in-person* program - you are expected to attend classes and labs.  There will be no recordings of lectures.  Interaction in class has been shown to improve understanding, and collaborative environments improve learning.

Attendance will be taken with iClicker.  To receive full marks, you must attend 6 of 8 classes.  Attendance in fewer classes than these will result in a grade of 0 for attendance.  I understand that illness and emergencies happen (if you are ill, please do not come to class). 


## Assessments

This is both an __assignment- and project-based course__. You'll be evaluated as follows:
